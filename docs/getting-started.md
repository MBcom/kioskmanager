# Getting Started: Accessing the Admin Panel

This guide assumes Kioskmanager has already been deployed and is accessible via a web browser. These initial steps are common for both Administrators and Content Managers.

1.  Navigate to the Kioskmanager admin URL provided by your system administrator (usually `http://<your-kioskmanager-address>/admin/`).
2.  You will see the Django administration login page.
3.  Enter the username and password provided to you.
4.  Click "Log in".

Once logged in, you will see the main admin dashboard. The sections and options available to you will depend on your assigned user role and permissions.
