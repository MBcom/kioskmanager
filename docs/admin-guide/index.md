# Admin Guide

Welcome to the Kioskmanager Administrator Guide.

This guide is intended for system administrators responsible for deploying, configuring, and maintaining the Kioskmanager application. It covers installation, managing display connections, and user account administration within Kioskmanager.

## Topics

* **[Installation](./installation.md):** Deploying Kioskmanager using the Helm chart on Kubernetes.
* **[Connecting & Managing Displays](./connecting-displays.md):** How new displays (browsers) register, and how admins can name them and assign them to initial groups.
* **[User Management](./user-management.md):** Creating user accounts, setting up roles, and assigning permissions for Kioskmanager.

Before you begin, ensure you have met all the [prerequisites outlined in the main project README.md](https://github.com/mbcom/kioskmanager#prerequisites-for-deployment) for deploying the Helm chart. You should also be familiar with [Accessing the Admin Panel](../getting-started.md).
